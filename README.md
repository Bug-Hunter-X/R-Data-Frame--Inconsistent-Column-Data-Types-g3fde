This repository demonstrates a common error in R when creating data frames: inconsistent data types within a single column.  The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to create a data frame with a mix of numeric and string values in column 'a'. This often leads to unexpected behavior during analysis. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.R`, addresses the inconsistency and prevents potential errors.
